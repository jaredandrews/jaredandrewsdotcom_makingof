Greetings! My name is Jared Andrews. I am a freelance software developer. I was raised in Central Massachusetts, went to college at WPI, and lived in Allston, MA for serveral years after. I am currently traveling the United States indefinitely. I work remotely with several clients on Android and Web Development projects. If you are interested in working on a project with me, please check out my [Portfolio]() and/or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredtandrews) and shoot me an email. I would love to build a great app or website with you!

During my time in Boston I cofounded Rock and Culture blog, [Spark & Fizz](https://sparkandfizz.com) with some of my friends. If you are interested in DIY music and culture I would ask you to check it out. Along with handling the tech side of things I frequently write, edit videos and conduct interviews for Spark & Fizz.

The purpose of this website is to host content I created that has nowhere else to live. What that entails will become clear over time :D
