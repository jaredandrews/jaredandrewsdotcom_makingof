    <p>Welcome to the first installment of "Making This Site". In these articles I will describe the exact steps I went through to build this site. </p>
<p>To view this post the way it looked by the end of making all the changes described in this article <a href="">click here</a></p>
<h3>Web Design Goals</h3>
<p>The purpose of this website is to store information and the output of various DIY projects I work on. As such, the requirements are simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog presentation</li>
<li>Lightweight and easy to view on computers and phones</li>
<li>Easy to maintain and add content to</li>
<li>Cheap to host</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind I set out to find a suitable static site generator (SSG) to build my site on. After reading about the pros and cons of many different static site generator I decided on <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/index.html">Pelican</a>.</p>
<p>My decision to use Pelican was primarily based on my pre-existing knowledge of Python and the fact that Pelican had almost all the features I thought I would need and not much more.</p>
<h3>Setting Up Pelican</h3>
<p>Setting up Pelican is quite simple. I followed the <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/quickstart.html">quickstart guide</a> to get get set up. The guide is quite thorough so I will not reiterate it.</p>
<p>Running <code>pelican-quickstart</code> generates a skeleton site with a default theme. It gets you set up to write a blog right away. Indeed, by the end of this article I will have a site that could, theoretically, go online.</p>
<p>Here are the options I used to generate my initial site:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ pelican-quickstart
Welcome to pelican-quickstart v3.6.3.

This script will <span class="nb">help</span> you create a new Pelican-based website.

<p>You can see the skeleton site by running <code>make html; make serve;</code> in the same directory as the makefile generated by <code>pelican-quickstart</code>. After, open your browser and go to <code>localhost:8000</code>. Here you will see the freshly generated site.</p>
<h3>Making My First Article</h3>
<p>After seeing the skeleton site I decided to write the article you are reading right now. Pelican provides the option to write articles in Markdown and a number of other languages. I decided to use Markdown, which is the default. In the root directory for your site you will find a <code>content</code> directory. This directory is where you store your articles.</p>
<p>To make this article I used the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ touch content/pelican_00_setup.md
</pre></div>


<p>Once the file was created I opened it and wrote this article. An article file needs to provide metadata for Pelican. Here is what the metadata for this article looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Title</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Making</span> <span class="n">This</span> <span class="n">Site</span> <span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Part</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Setup</span> 
<span class="n">Date</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">2015</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">01</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">02</span>
</pre></div>


<p>For this article I used a number of Markdown features within the
text. <code>*</code> creates a bullet point. <code>#</code> indicates that the line
is a header. I also prefaced lines of code with at least four spaces
so they would be shown in a code block.</p>
<h4>Tags and Categories</h4>
<p>Each post can also have a single category and a list of associated
tags. Underneath the title and date information in the Markdown for
this post I have also included:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Tags</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">programming</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">web</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">pelican</span>
<span class="n">Category</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">making</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">site</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Each post can have a single category. I imagine that typically I will
only use categories when I want to group specific posts together, for
example, I would want a visitor of this site to be able to to view all
of the "Making This Site" posts in one place, thus I have created the
<code>making-this-site</code> category.</p>
<p>Tags are additional meta-data that can be used to find related
posts. Typically I will provide a very general tag and then a few more
specific ones. I try not to go wild with the tags, I know some sites
do.</p>
<p>At this point, with very little effort, I have a working blog with one article on it. To view the site in this state checkout COMMIT HASH LINK on GitHub.</p>
